This is the program of Scrabble game with two user: a human player 
and computer.
First, all the layouts are loaded onto the anchorpane.
Then, player gets the first turn. When player finishes his
turn by clicking play button, the words are checked if it 
exists in dictionary. If the player gets all words right, then 
he gets points for that words. If any of the words doesn't 
exist in the dictionary then all the tiles set by players
is redrawn into the rack of tiles and player plays again.

The part where computer plays is not completed. The player's part
works fine.

Playing Guide:

When the layout is shown, it is automatically the player's turn. Player have
to click the button and then click on whichever cell they want
to put the tiles on. I don't have the drag functionality. So, clicking button and cell
does the job of placing tile on the desired cell on the game board.
After player is done putting the tiles, all the words formed as a
result of tiles will be checked and if all are right, then player gets
points for the words. All the words should be in the dictionary. If all the
words are right, then the players turn is over and computer comes into play. Computer functionlaity is 
not complete so it just returns the player's turn. You can play as long as there is possibility of playing.
